# TokenOptimizer Dashboard Requirements

## Project Overview

TokenOptimizer Dashboard provides AI developers with visibility and optimization suggestions for their LLM API usage. It visualizes token spend across different models and features while recommending comparable models that may be cheaper or better suited to specific use cases.

## Target Users

- AI developers and teams using LLM APIs
- Engineering managers tracking LLM costs
- Product teams optimizing AI feature costs

## Core Requirements

### 1. Primary Objectives

- [x] Visualize LLM usage costs across models and features
- [x] Identify cost optimization opportunities
- [x] Provide actionable insights for model selection
- [x] Track performance metrics (latency, success rates)
- [x] Analyze usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities

### 2. Key Metrics to Display

#### Cost Metrics (Highest Priority)
- [ ] Total spend with trend indicators
- [ ] Cost by model
- [ ] Cost by feature/endpoint
- [ ] Average cost per request (more valuable than per-token)
- [ ] Projected monthly/annual costs

#### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Average latency by model
- [ ] Success/failure rates
- [ ] Throughput (requests per hour/day)
- [ ] Performance trends over time

#### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Model comparisons with alternatives
- [ ] Estimated savings potential
- [ ] Quality impact assessment
- [ ] One-click testing capability

#### Usage Patterns
- [ ] Peak usage times
- [ ] Endpoint utilization
- [ ] Request volume trends
- [ ] Prompt length analysis

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Overview Section
- [ ] Summary cards showing key metrics
- [ ] Cost trends chart
- [ ] Total optimization potential

### 2. Cost Analysis
- [ ] Cost breakdown by model (bar chart)
- [ ] Cost breakdown by feature (bar chart)
- [ ] Cost trend over time (line chart)

### 3. Model Optimization Table
- [ ] Current model
- [ ] Recommended alternatives
- [ ] Estimated savings
- [ ] Quality impact
- [ ] Testing capability

### 4. Performance Insights
- [ ] Latency by model
- [ ] Success rates
- [ ] Cost vs performance visualization

### 5. Usage Patterns
- [ ] Usage heatmap by time
- [ ] Request volume trends
- [ ] Token efficiency analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Data Sources
- [ ] Token logs database
- [ ] Model pricing information
- [ ] Model capabilities database
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Backend Services
- [ ] Unified dashboard data service
- [ ] LangChain agent for model recommendations
- [ ] Caching layer for performance
- [ ] Scheduled data aggregation jobs

### Frontend
- [ ] React dashboard with TypeScript
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- [ ] Interactive visualizations with Recharts
- [ ] Filtering by date range, model, and feature

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- [ ] Basic dashboard layout
- [ ] Cost visualization by model and feature
- [ ] Simple model recommendations
- [ ] Core metrics display

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Usage pattern analysis
- [ ] Advanced filtering
- [ ] Historical trends

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization
- [ ] LangChain-powered recommendations
- [ ] One-click model testing
- [ ] Custom alerts and recommendations
- [ ] Export and reporting capabilities

## Success Criteria

1. Dashboard provides clear visualization of LLM costs
2. Users can identify at least 3 optimization opportunities
3. Recommendations lead to measurable cost savings
4. Interface is intuitive and loads within 2 seconds
5. Data refreshes automatically with minimal delay

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance: Dashboard loads in <3 seconds
2. Scalability: Handles up to 1M token log entries
3. Security: Data is properly secured and access-controlled
4. Reliability: 99.9% uptime for dashboard services
