# TokenOptimizer 2-Week Sprint Plan

## Git Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code, always stable
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/[feature-name]` - Individual feature branches
- `hotfix/[fix-name]` - Emergency fixes for production issues

Workflow:
1. Create feature branch from develop: `git checkout -b feature/analytics-endpoint develop`
2. Work on feature, commit frequently
3. When complete, merge to develop: `git checkout develop && git merge --no-ff feature/analytics-endpoint`
4. Test on develop branch
5. When ready for release, merge develop to main

## Domain & Hosting Strategy

- Domain: tokenoptimizer.com (already purchased)
- Frontend hosting: Vercel (connects easily to GitHub)
- Backend hosting: Railway or Render (easy deployment, reasonable pricing)
- Database: Supabase (already using for storage)

Early setup:
- Configure DNS for tokenoptimizer.com on Day 2
- Deploy minimal backend by Day 3
- Deploy dashboard skeleton by Day 4
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments

## Sprint 2: SDK Packaging & Monetization (Week 2)

### Day 6-7: SDK Improvements
- [ ] Document current integration patterns
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Create examples for other LLM providers
- [ ] Update configuration options

**Branch:** `feature/sdk-improvements`

### Day 8-9: SDK Packaging & API Key System
- [ ] Finalize SDK package structure
- [ ] Implement API key validation
- [ ] Create simple user registration for key generation
- [ ] Add usage tracking in backend
- [ ] Prepare for PyPI distribution

**Branch:** `feature/api-key-system`

### Day 10: Launch Preparation
- [ ] Set up production deployment
- [ ] Create simple landing page on tokenoptimizer.com
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Implement basic Stripe integration for plans
- [ ] Package v0.1.0 release
- [ ] Merge develop to main for initial launch

**Branch:** `feature/launch-prep` and final merge to `main`

## Hosting Configuration Details

### Frontend (Vercel)
- Connect GitHub repository
- Configure build command: `npm run build`
- Set environment variables for API endpoints
- Set up automatic deployments from develop branch
- Configure custom domain: tokenoptimizer.com
- Set up preview deployments for feature branches

### Backend (Railway or Render)
- Connect GitHub repository
- Configure Python environment
- Set environment variables (Supabase credentials, etc.)
- Set up automatic deployments from develop branch
- Configure domain: api.tokenoptimizer.com
- Set up health check endpoints

### Database (Supabase)
- No changes needed to existing setup
- Create backup policy
- Set up additional tables for user management:
  - users
  - api_keys
  - usage_stats

## Immediate Action Items (Today)

1. **Set up Git repository with proper structure**
   ```bash
   # Initialize repository if not already done
   git init
   
   # Create initial branches
   git checkout -b develop
   git checkout -b feature/analytics-endpoints
   ```

2. **Create analytics endpoint for summary data**
   ```bash
   # Create the endpoint
   # Test with existing data
   # Commit changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add summary analytics endpoint"
   ```

3. **Initialize hosting accounts**
   - Create Vercel account if needed
   - Set up Railway or Render account
   - Configure initial projects

4. **Document current SDK integration**
   - Create documentation file for current Asystant integration
   - Add to repository

## Risk Mitigation

1. **SDK Compatibility**
   - Create separate test branch for SDK changes
   - Test against Asystant integration before merging
   - Keep backward compatibility as highest priority
   - Version the API endpoints

2. **Hosting Issues**
   - Set up monitoring from day one
   - Create fallback deployment options
   - Document deployment process

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Implement database backups immediately
   - Create data migration scripts
   - Test with copies of production data

## Communication & Tracking

- Daily commits with descriptive messages
- Update this plan file as progress is made
- Track completed items with check marks [x]
- Document any blockers or issues encountered
